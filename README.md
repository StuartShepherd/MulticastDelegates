# Multicast Delegates Example
A great feature of delegates is that you can combine them together. This is called multicasting.
You can use the + or += operator to add another method to the invocation list of an existing delegate instance.
Similarly, you can also remove a method from an invocation list by using the decrement assignment operator (- or -=).
